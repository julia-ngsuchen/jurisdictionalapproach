        <item id="introHead">Introduction</item>
        <item id="introText">The Jurisdictional Approach (JA) is a relatively new concept. Ideas on what it can actually achieve is vague as JAs around the world are still being implemented or in the progress of being implemented. It is also often contradictory with opposing viewpoints from the economic and conservation sectors. {br}{br}Therefore we ask:{br}{br}{b}"In your opinion, what should ideally be the outcomes of the JA when it is implemented?"{/b}{br}{br}{u} Note: Please write down or take a photo of the question in bold sentence so that you can refer to it while sorting the statements.{/u}</item>

        <!-- step1: rough sorting into three piles (leave blank to skip popup)-->
        <item id="step1Head">Step 1 of 5</item>
        <item id="step1Text">Read the following statements carefully and split them up into three piles: a pile for statements you tend to disagree with, a pile for cards you tend to agree with, and a pile for the rest.{br}{br}You can either drag the cards into one of the three piles or {b}press 1, 2, 3{/b} on your keyboard. Changes can be made later.{br}{br}If you want to read this instruction a second time, press the help-button at the bottom left corner.</item>

        <!-- step2: sorting (leave blank to skip popup) -->
        <item id="step2Head">Step 2 of 5</item>
        <item id="step2Text">Take the cards from the "MOST IMPORTANT"-pile and arrange them on right side of the score sheet. 4 is the statement you think is the most important, followed by 3 and so on. {br}{br}Next, take the cards from the "LEAST IMPORTANT"-pile and arrange them on the left side of the score sheet. -4 is the statement you think is the least important, followed by -3 and so on. Follow this procedure for all cards in the "MOST IMPORTANT"- and "LEAST IMPORTANT"-piles.{br}{br}Finally, take the "NEUTRAL"-cards arrange them in the remaining open boxes of the score sheet. {br}{br}Note:{br}{br}(1)Assigning a statement to the -ve ranking need not be a disagreement. It means you agree with it less than the ones ranked immediately, and slightly more than the ones ranked below it. The same goes for the +ve statements.{br}{br}(2) There are no right or wrong answers, this is entirely your opinion.
